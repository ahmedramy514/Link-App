          Dear VChat Users, I regret to inform you that an unexpected issue has
          led to the loss of data in the chats database.
          <br />
          <br />
          As the sole developer, I take full responsibility for this incident
          and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience it may cause.
          Unfortunately, this means that your chat history and associated data
          have been reset.
          <br />
          <br />I understand the frustration this may cause, and I'm working
          tirelessly to rectify the situation and prevent such occurrences in
          the future.
          <br />
          <br />
          Best regards,
          <br /> Vincent Mukuna
